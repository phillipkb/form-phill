// Query all form input fields on the apge

// Render a clone of each input in the dropdown

// Values written to those forms are stored in locally
    // Where should I write it?
    // Local storage for now

// Submit button to fill each form with the cache'd value

// EXTRA
// Some method of submitting the form from the extension
// Maybe switch to action recording & replay  that auto-fills the extension's form fields with whatever
// actions you took during the recording.
// Maybe it runs in the background and always cache's your form values 
// This should be stateless, persisting form fields, even for testing, feels dangerous
